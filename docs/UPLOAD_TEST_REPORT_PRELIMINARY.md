## 🔍 **FINDINGS**

### **Issue #1: Missing Dependency - @headlessui/react** ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** FIXED  

**Description:**
- `CreateAlbumModal` component uses `@headlessui/react` Dialog
- Package was not installed in `package.json`
- Modal failed to render when button clicked

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ grep "@headlessui/react" package.json
# No output - package missing
```

**Impact:**

**Root Cause:**
- Missing dependency in package.json

npm install @headlessui/react
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Package installed successfully
- ✅ No console errors
- ⏳ Pending: Dev server restart to load new package

### **Issue #2: Dev Server Needs Restart** ⏳ PENDING

**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** PENDING  

**Description:**

**Status:** OPEN
